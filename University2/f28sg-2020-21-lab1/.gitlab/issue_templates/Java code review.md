# Code Simplicity

1. Is the code as simple as it could be?
2. Could the code be shorter? If so, how?
3. Could the programmer reduce the number of if and while statements
   (control flow)?
4. Could the programmer reduce the number of for loops (iteration)?
5. Is the (Big-O) complexity of the code more than what is required?
   If so, suggest how to reduce the code's worst case complexity.
6. Could the programmer remove any code without changing a method's
   output (dead code)?
7. Are there any unused variables?
8. Is there any duplication of code in the same Java class file?
